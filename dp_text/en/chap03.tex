\chapter{Geodesics}
Of special importance in theory of the ground state manifold are geodesics. Its not yet clear what role they have in general, but there are known cases where they play a role of "maximum fidelity at any time" transport. This means, that if we compare geodesic $\mathcal{G}(t)$ with some curve $\gamma(t)$ spanning between points $P_i$ and $P_f$ during some time $t_f$, i.e. $\mathcal{G}(0)=\gamma(0)=P_i$, $\mathcal{G}(t_f)=\gamma(t_f)=P_f$, at any given time $t$ the fidelity on corresponding point of $\mathcal{G}$ will be less than of $\gamma$. This does not necesarilly mean, that the overall fidelity will be smaller for geodesics. WHYYYYY?????
