One of big unsolved problems of the modern physics in constructing quantum computers. There are many mathematical problems, which are solvable in exponential time on computers with classical bits, but are solvable in polynomial time using quantum computing. The implications here are mainly to so-called \emph{adiabatic quantum computers}, where the solution to problem is substituted for minima finding in some system of coupled qubits\footnote{As qubits one might use for example quantum dots \citep{dots}, or Josephson junctions \citep{josephson}.}. Usually one starts with some simple system configuration (for example \emph{all spins up}), let's call this configuration \emph{initial state}, and changes it to suitable condition (\emph{final state}), from which the system energetic minima is found, representing solution to spefic problem. With the phase of finding the energy minima, there are many problems (holding the superposition of states long enough etc.), which will not be addressed here. What will be the point of interest of this thesis is the \emph{driving} from initial to final state. This driving usually needs to be performed \emph{adiabatically}, i.e., without excitation of the system. The probability that the state will remain in a ground state during such transport (\emph{driving}) is called the \emph{fidelity}. For illustration of this problem see Fig. \ref{fig:introDriving}, where two scenarios are drawn. First, the state moves adiabatically, second, the state excites in the small energy gap area, devaluating the experiment.

This problem is of course more general. From mathematical point of view, in the example above we have \emph{parameter driven Hamiltonian} $\HH(\llambda)$ between qubits (omitting the thermal basis of the environment and other effects), which depends on some vector $\llambda$ from \emph{parameter space}. Changing of the driving parameter (for example orientation of a magnetic field, or qubit coupling) influences the qubits and \emph{drives} them to some final superposition state.

The question of interest is: “How to achieve the better \emph{final fidelity}, meaning \emph{how to prepare the state we want to prepare with the highest possible probability}?” During the driving one might add some energy to the qubit, which leads to its excitation and possibly destroys the superposition. This can be improved by many methods. From the theory of \emph{quantum state driving} three methods are emphasized here — \emph{adiabatic driving}, \emph{counter-diabatic driving}, or \emph{choosing better driving path}. Adiabatic driving can be performed by infinitely slow drivings, making it unsuitable for practical applications. Counter-diabatic driving requires adding another element to the Hamiltonian, which leads to \emph{unit fidelity protocols} (the system does not excite), making it a good candidate for practical applications. The method of finding better driving path can be combined with all other methods, and means that different paths in parameter space lead to different fidelity. Because these trajectories are influenced by energy spectra, one might be interested in the \emph{quantum state manifolds}. These are especially important for some drivings, such as driving using small \emph{quenches} (quick, but small changes in driving parameter), or close-adiabatic driving, where the fidelity is almost one.

To understand the geometry of quantum state driving, the basics of differential geometry are presented in Chapter \ref{chap:mathIntro}. It does not serve the ifull theory, only some basic intuition is build and useful definitions are provided here. The theory of quantum driving itself is described in Chapter \ref{chap:driving}. First the geometrical space is constructed, then the concept of \emph{quantum state driving}, \emph{fidelity} and \emph{metric tensor} are introduced.
The driving methods are described in Chapter \ref{chap:typesOfDriving}. Especially \emph{counter-diabatic}, \emph{adiabatic} and \emph{close-adiabatic} drivings are introduced, along with reformulation of theorems about fidelity. Special importance is played by the \emph{ground state manifold} and geodesics, for which some applications are proposed.

To understand the general fidelity driving, a simple two level system is analyzed in Chapter \ref{chap:twoLevelSystem}. Driving fidelity and energy variance are calculated for two special drivings — \emph{linear} and \emph{geodesic}. This demonstrates some basic phenomena which occur in quantum state driving in general. Finally, the more convoluted Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model is analyzed in Chapter \ref{chap:lipkin}. Here the analysis was split into different dimensional cases and finally generalized to general dimension. Focus is especially on the ground state manifold and geometrical structures on it. This can help to understand drivings with unit or almost unit fidelity.
