	journal = {Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical},
	abstract = {For a general quantum system driven by a slowly time-dependent Hamiltonian, transitions between instantaneous eigenstates are exponentially weak. But a nearby Hamiltonian exists for which the transition amplitudes between any eigenstates of the original Hamiltonian are exactly zero for all values of slowness. The general theory is illustrated by spins driven by changing magnetic fields, and implies that any spin expectation history, including those where the spin never precesses, can be generated by infinitely many driving fields, here displayed explicitly. Asymptotically, the absence of transitions is explained by continuation to complex time, where the complex degeneracies in the transitionless driving fields have a nongeneric structure for which there is no Stokes phenomenon; this is analogous to the explanation of reflectionless potentials.}

@article{ashtekar_geometrical_1997,
	title = {Geometrical {Formulation} of {Quantum} {Mechanics}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9706069},
	abstract = {States of a quantum mechanical system are represented by rays in a complex Hilbert space. The space of rays has, naturally, the structure of a Ka¨hler manifold. This leads to a geometrical formulation of the postulates of quantum mechanics which, although equivalent to the standard algebraic formulation, has a very diﬀerent appearance. In particular, states are now represented by points of a symplectic manifold (which happens to have, in addition, a compatible Riemannian metric), observables are represented by certain realvalued functions on this space and the Schro¨dinger evolution is captured by the symplectic ﬂow generated by a Hamiltonian function. There is thus a remarkable similarity with the standard symplectic formulation of classical mechanics. Features—such as uncertainties and state vector reductions—which are speciﬁc to quantum mechanics can also be formulated geometrically but now refer to the Riemannian metric—a structure which is absent in classical mechanics. The geometrical formulation sheds considerable light on a number of issues such as the second quantization procedure, the role of coherent states in semi-classical considerations and the WKB approximation. More importantly, it suggests generalizations of quantum mechanics. The simplest among these are equivalent to the dynamical generalizations that have appeared in the literature. The geometrical reformulation provides a uniﬁed framework to discuss these and to correct a misconception. Finally, it also suggests directions in which more radical generalizations may be found.},
