Quantum operators are denoted with \emph{hat}. Coordinate derivative is sometimes denoted using comma and covariant derivative using semicolon. 

The colored text is sometimes used during the derivations. The text can be understood without the colors, its goal is strictly pedagogical and helps reader to see some underlying connections.
