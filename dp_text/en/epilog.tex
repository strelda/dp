In this thesis, the mathematical reformulation of quantum state driving theory of finite Hamiltonian systems is presented. The playground in a form of fiber space is constructed and geometry of energy states reformulated on it. Some theorems were proposed, based on previous knowledge from the area of physics concerning quantum state driving and clear definitions of generally used terms is presented.

From a simple two level system, the correspondence to a damped harmonic oscillator in the fidelity behavior was shown. In a case of geodesic driving, the fidelity oscillates with constant frequency and periodically becomes one. For linear driving, the fidelity has essentially two regimes â€” fast transport regime, described by semiclassical Landau-Zener formula, and close adiabatic regime, described by APT. In both models, the fidelity is excited when energy levels get close to each other, especially in a presence of diabolic points. These excitations lead to damped oscillations.

In LMG model, the ground state manifold is analyzed. The Riemannian manifold characteristics were calculated along with its implications. These are ground state manifold geodesics and coordinates of diabolic points in parametric space, dependent on Hamiltonian dimension. In three dimensions, this was done analytically, proving the existence of diabolic points. For higher dimensions, numerical methods were used. In the end, the transport using quenches was numerically demonstrated, showing the transformation to adiabatic transport by shortening the quenches.

Many questions still lay unsolved and some were newly opened. For example: "What are the possibilities for quantum quench transport?". "What is the correspondence of energy variance and driving fidelity?". Further on, from the LMG model, the proposed analytical formula for diabolic points coordinates remains to be proven analytically, along with the number of these points.

This thesis provides a great amount of numerical analysis on two quantum models, which will hopefully serve for future discoveries in this area of physics. The state manifold analyses might lead the finding of better fidelity protocols, or maybe the geodesics will be found to be somewhat "most stable protocols" for counter-diabatic driving. Either way, the possibilities are yet open and not known.
