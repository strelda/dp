abstract = {In these lecture notes, partly based on a course taught at the Karpacz Winter School in March 2014, we explore the close connections between non-adiabatic response of a system with respect to macroscopic parameters and the geometry of quantum and classical states. We center our discussion around adiabatic gauge potentials, which are the generators of unitary basis transformations in quantum systems and generators of special canonical transformations in classical systems. In quantum systems, eigenstate expectation values of these potentials are the Berry connections and the covariance matrix of these gauge potentials is the geometric tensor, whose antisymmetric part defines the Berry curvature and whose symmetric part is the Fubini-Study metric tensor. In classical systems one simply replaces the eigenstate expectation value by an average over the micro-canonical shell. For complicated interacting systems, we show that a variational principle may be used to derive approximate gauge potentials. We then express the non-adiabatic response of the physical observables of the system through these gauge potentials, specifically demonstrating the close connection of the geometric tensor to the notions of Lorentz force and renormalized mass. We highlight applications of this formalism to deriving counter-diabatic (dissipationless) driving protocols in various systems, as well as to finding equations of motion for slow macroscopic parameters coupled to fast microscopic degrees of freedom that go beyond macroscopic Hamiltonian dynamics. Finally, we illustrate these ideas with a number of simple examples and highlight a few more complicated ones drawn from recent literature.}

@article{berry1984,
  abstract = {A quantal system in an eigenstate, slowly transported round a circuit C by varying parameters $\mathbf{R}$ in its Hamiltonian $\hat{H}(\mathrm{R})$, will acquire a geometrical phase factor $\exp {i\gamma(\mathrm{C})}$ in addition to the familiar dynamical phase factor. An explicit general formula for $\gamma$(C) is derived in terms of the spectrum and eigenstates of $\hat{H}(\mathbf{R})$ over a surface spanning C. If C lies near a degeneracy of $\hat{H}, \gamma$(C) takes a simple form which includes as a special case the sign change of eigenfunctions of real symmetric matrices round a degeneracy. As an illustration $\gamma$(C) is calculated for spinning particles in slowly-changing magnetic fields; although the sign reversal of spinors on rotation is a special case, the effect is predicted to occur for bosons as well as fermions, and a method for observing it is proposed. It is shown that the Aharonov-Bohm effect can be interpreted as a geometrical phase factor.},

	journal = {Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical},
	abstract = {For a general quantum system driven by a slowly time-dependent Hamiltonian, transitions between instantaneous eigenstates are exponentially weak. But a nearby Hamiltonian exists for which the transition amplitudes between any eigenstates of the original Hamiltonian are exactly zero for all values of slowness. The general theory is illustrated by spins driven by changing magnetic fields, and implies that any spin expectation history, including those where the spin never precesses, can be generated by infinitely many driving fields, here displayed explicitly. Asymptotically, the absence of transitions is explained by continuation to complex time, where the complex degeneracies in the transitionless driving fields have a nongeneric structure for which there is no Stokes phenomenon; this is analogous to the explanation of reflectionless potentials.}
