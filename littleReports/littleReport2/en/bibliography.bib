@article{Bukov2019,
abstract = {We analyze state preparation within a restricted space of local control parameters between adiabatically connected states of control Hamiltonians. We formulate a conjecture that the time integral of energy fluctuations over the protocol duration is bounded from below by the geodesic length set by the quantum geometric tensor. The conjecture implies a geometric lower bound for the quantum speed limit (QSL). We prove the conjecture for arbitrary, sufficiently slow protocols using adiabatic perturbation theory and show that the bound is saturated by geodesic protocols, which keep the energy variance constant along the trajectory. Our conjecture implies that any optimal unit-fidelity protocol, even those that drive the system far from equilibrium, are fundamentally constrained by the quantum geometry of adiabatic evolution. When the control space includes all possible couplings, spanning the full Hilbert space, we recover the well-known Mandelstam-Tamm bound. However, using only accessible local controls to anneal in complex models such as glasses or to target individual excited states in quantum chaotic systems, the geometric bound for the quantum speed limit can be exponentially large in the system size due to a diverging geodesic length. We validate our conjecture both analytically by constructing counter-diabatic and fast-forward protocols for a three-level system, and numerically in nonintegrable spin chains and a nonlocal SYK model.},

@article{Rigolin2008,
abstract = {We introduce a perturbative approach to solving the time-dependent Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation, named adiabatic perturbation theory (APT), whose zeroth-order term is the quantum adiabatic approximation. The small parameter in the power series expansion of the time-dependent wave function is the inverse of the time it takes to drive the system's Hamiltonian from the initial to its final form. We review other standard perturbative and nonperturbative ways of going beyond the adiabatic approximation, extending and finding exact relations among them, and also compare the efficiency of those methods against the APT. Most importantly, we determine APT corrections to the Berry phase by use of the Aharonov-Anandan geometric phase. We then solve several time-dependent problems, allowing us to illustrate that the APT is the only perturbative method that gives the right corrections to the adiabatic approximation. Finally, we propose an experiment to measure the APT corrections to the Berry phase and show, for a particular spin- 1/2 problem, that to first order in APT the geometric phase should be two and a half times the (adiabatic) Berry phase. {\textcopyright} 2008 The American Physical Society.},

@article{DeGrandi2010,
abstract = {Dynamics in closed systems recently attracted a lot of theoretical interest largely following experimental developments in cold atom systems (see e.g., [1] for a review). Several spectacular experiments already explored different aspects of non-equilibrium dynamics in interacting many-particle systems [2-8]. Recent theoretical works in this context focused on various topics, for instance: connection of dynamics and thermodynamics [9-11 M. Rigol, unpublished], dynamics following a sudden quench Sudden quench in low dimensional systems [11-23, L. Mathey and A. Polkovnikov, unpublished; A. Iucci and M.A. Cazalilla,unpublished], adiabatic dynamics near quantum critical points [24-37, D. Chowdhury et al., unpublished; K. Sengupta and D. Sen, unpublished; A.P. Itin and P. T{\"{o}}rm{\"{a}}, unpublished; F. Pollmann et al., unpublished] Critical point!quantum and others. Though there is still very limited understanding of the generic aspects of non-equilibrium quantum dynamics, it has been recognized that such issues as integrability, dimensionality, universality (near critical points) can be explored to understand the non-equilibrium behavior of many-particle systems in various specific situations. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},
