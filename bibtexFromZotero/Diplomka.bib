Knowledge of such bounds, called quantum speed limits, is of utmost importance in virtually all areas of physics, where determination of the minimum time required for a quantum process is of interest. Most {MT} and {ML} inequalities found in the literature have been derived from growth estimates for the Bures length, which is a statistical distance measure. In this paper we derive such inequalities by differential geometric methods, and we compare the quantum speed limits obtained with those involving the Bures length. We also characterize the Hamiltonians which optimize the evolution time for generic ﬁnite-level quantum systems.},

An explicit general formula for γ(C) is derived in terms of the spectrum and eigenstates of Ĥ(R) over a surface spanning C. If C lies near a degeneracy of Ĥ, γ(C) takes a simple form which includes as a special case the sign change of eigenfunctions of real symmetric matrices round a degeneracy. As an illustration γ(C) is calculated for spinning particles in slowly-changing magnetic fields; although the sign reversal of spinors on rotation is a special case, the effect is predicted to occur for bosons as well as fermions, and a method for observing it is proposed. It is shown that the Aharonov-Bohm effect can be interpreted as a geometrical phase factor.},

Asymptotically, the absence of transitions is explained by continuation to complex time, where the complex degeneracies in the transitionless driving ﬁelds have a nongeneric structure for which there is no Stokes phenomenon; this is analogous to the explanation of reﬂectionless potentials.},

However, recent advances in quantum information theory have highlighted the role of its symmetric counterpart, the quantum metric tensor. In this paper, we perform a detailed analysis of the ground state Riemannian geometry induced by the metric tensor, using the quantum {XY} chain in a transverse field as our primary example. We focus on a particular geometric invariant -- the Gaussian curvature -- and show how both integrals of the curvature within a given phase and singularities of the curvature near phase transitions are protected by critical scaling theory. For cases where the curvature is integrable, we show that the integrated curvature provides a new geometric invariant, which like the Chern number characterizes individual phases of matter. For cases where the curvature is singular, we classify three types -- integrable, conical, and curvature singularities -- and detail situations where each type of singularity should arise. Finally, to connect this abstract geometry to experiment, we discuss three different methods for measuring the metric tensor, namely via integrating a properly weighted noise spectral function and by using leading order responses of the work distribution to ramps and quenches in quantum many-body systems.},

With its origin in quantum information and in the differential geometry perspective of quantum states, the fidelity susceptibility can indicate the presence of a phase transition without prior knowledge of the local order parameter, as well as reveal the universal properties of a critical point. The wide applicability of the fidelity susceptibility to quantum many-body systems is, however, hindered by the limited computational tools to evaluate it. We present a generic, efficient, and elegant approach to compute the fidelity susceptibility of correlated fermions, bosons, and quantum spin systems in a broad range of quantum Monte Carlo methods. It can be applied both to the ground-state and non-zero temperature cases. The Monte Carlo estimator has a simple yet universal form, which can be efficiently evaluated in simulations. We demonstrate the power of this approach with applications to the Bose-Hubbard model, the spin-\$1/2\$ {XXZ} model, and use it to examine the hypothetical intermediate spin-liquid phase in the Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice.},

Lett. 108, 190602 (2012)] to quantum non-dissipative systems. The space of controllable parameters of isolated quantum many-body systems is endowed with a Riemannian quantum metric structure, which can be exploited when such systems are driven adiabatically. Here, we use this metric structure to construct optimal protocols in order to accomplish the task of adiabatic ground-state preparation in a fixed amount of time. Such optimal protocols are shown to be geodesics on the parameter manifold, maximizing the local fidelity. Physically, such protocols minimize the average energy fluctuations along the path. Our findings are illustrated on the Landau-Zener model and the anisotropic {XY} spin chain. In both cases we show that geodesic protocols drastically improve the final fidelity. Moreover, this happens even if one crosses a critical point, where the adiabatic perturbation theory fails.},

We formulate a conjecture that the time integral of energy fluctuations over the protocol duration is bounded from below by the geodesic length set by the quantum geometric tensor. The conjecture implies a geometric lower bound for the quantum speed limit ({QSL}). We prove the conjecture for arbitrary, sufficiently slow protocols using adiabatic perturbation theory and show that the bound is saturated by geodesic protocols, which keep the energy variance constant along the trajectory. Our conjecture implies that any optimal unit-fidelity protocol, even those that drive the system far from equilibrium, are fundamentally constrained by the quantum geometry of adiabatic evolution. When the control space includes all possible couplings, spanning the full Hilbert space, we recover the well-known Mandelstam-Tamm bound. However, using only accessible local controls to anneal in complex models such as glasses or to target individual excited states in quantum chaotic systems, the geometric bound for the quantum speed limit can be exponentially large in the system size due to a diverging geodesic length. We validate our conjecture both analytically by constructing counter-diabatic and fast-forward protocols for a three-level system, and numerically in nonintegrable spin chains and a nonlocal {SYK} model.},

	abstract = {Non-Abelian and non-adiabatic variants of Berry's geometric phase have been pivotal in the recent advances in fault tolerant quantum computation gates, while Berry's phase itself is at the heart of the study of topological phases of matter. The geometrical and topological properties of the phase space of spin\$-1\$ quantum states is richer than that of spin\$-1/2\$ quantum states and is relatively unexplored. For instance, the spin vector of a spin-1 system, unlike that of a spin\$-1/2\$ system, can lie anywhere on or inside the Bloch sphere representing the phase space. Recently, a generalization of Berry's phase that encapsulates the topology of spin-1 quantum states has been formulated in J. Math. Phys., 59(6), 062105. This geometric phase includes loops that go inside the Bloch sphere and is carried by the tensor of spin fluctuations, unlike Berry's phase which is carried by the global phase of the quantum state. Furthermore, due to a mathematical singularity at the center of the Bloch sphere, the class of loops that pass through the center are called singular loops and are significant because their geometric phase is non-Abelian. In contrast with Berry's phase for spin\$-1/2\$ systems, whose properties come from the topology of a sphere, the properties of singular loop geometric phases come from the topology of the real projective plane \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{{RP}\}{\textasciicircum}2\$, which is more non-trivial. Here we use coherent control of ultracold \${\textasciicircum}\{87\}\$Rb atoms in an optical trap to experimentally explore this geometric phase for singular loops in a spin-1 quantum system.},

The small parameter in the power series expansion of the time-dependent wave function is the inverse of the time it takes to drive the system's Hamiltonian from the initial to its final form. We review other standard perturbative and non-perturbative ways of going beyond the adiabatic approximation, extending and finding exact relations among them, and also compare the efficiency of those methods against the {APT}. Most importantly, we determine {APT} corrections to the Berry phase by use of the Aharonov-Anandan geometric phase. We then solve several time dependent problems allowing us to illustrate that the {APT} is the only perturbative method that gives the right corrections to the adiabatic approximation. Finally, we propose an experiment to measure the {APT} corrections to the Berry phase and show, for a particular spin-1/2 problem, that to first order in {APT} the geometric phase should be two and a half times the (adiabatic) Berry phase.},

Within this approach we derive the scaling of various quantities such as the density of generated defects, entropy and energy. We discuss the applications of this approach to a specific situation where the system crosses a quantum critical point.

In this paper we unify these two approaches showing that the underlying mechanism is the critical singular behavior of a complex tensor over the Hamiltonian parameter space. This is achieved by performing a scaling analysis of this quantum geometric tensor in the vicinity of the critical points. In this way most of the previous results are understood on general grounds and new ones are found. We show that criticality is not a sufficient condition to ensure superextensive divergence of the geometric tensor, and state the conditions under which this is possible. The validity of this analysis is further checked by exact diagonalization of the spin-1/2 {XXZ} Heisenberg chain.},
