	title = {{GEOMETRIC} {QUANTIZATION}},
	abstract = {Geometric Quantization ({GQ}) is a program for obtaining a quantum mechanical system given a classical mechanical system. The object of quantization need not be a physically feasible mechanical system, symplectic manifolds (with suﬃciently nice properties) are also quantizable. For example, the quantization procedure for attaining spin originates from the 2-sphere, and not a cotangent bundle of some phase space. However, quantization is not a categorical functor between symplectic manifolds and quantum mechanical spaces, therefore this procedure may not seem completely natural. This expository paper assumes little background in diﬀerential geometry, and some familiarity with analytical mechanics, and quantum mechanics.},

	title = {Geometrical Formulation of Quantum Mechanics},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9706069},
	abstract = {States of a quantum mechanical system are represented by rays in a complex Hilbert space. The space of rays has, naturally, the structure of a Ka¨hler manifold. This leads to a geometrical formulation of the postulates of quantum mechanics which, although equivalent to the standard algebraic formulation, has a very diﬀerent appearance. In particular, states are now represented by points of a symplectic manifold (which happens to have, in addition, a compatible Riemannian metric), observables are represented by certain realvalued functions on this space and the Schro¨dinger evolution is captured by the symplectic ﬂow generated by a Hamiltonian function. There is thus a remarkable similarity with the standard symplectic formulation of classical mechanics. Features—such as uncertainties and state vector reductions—which are speciﬁc to quantum mechanics can also be formulated geometrically but now refer to the Riemannian metric—a structure which is absent in classical mechanics. The geometrical formulation sheds considerable light on a number of issues such as the second quantization procedure, the role of coherent states in semi-classical considerations and the {WKB} approximation. More importantly, it suggests generalizations of quantum mechanics. The simplest among these are equivalent to the dynamical generalizations that have appeared in the literature. The geometrical reformulation provides a uniﬁed framework to discuss these and to correct a misconception. Finally, it also suggests directions in which more radical generalizations may be found.},
